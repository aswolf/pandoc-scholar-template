# Template for pandoc-scholar articles
* A simple template for creating manuscripts using pandoc-scholar
* This template is based on the original pandoc-scholar manuscript repo (https://github.com/robert-winkler/scientific-articles-markdown.git) and the example article included with the pandoc-scholar install

* Note that this template modifies some of the pandoc-scholar defaults in order to organize and simplify use.
